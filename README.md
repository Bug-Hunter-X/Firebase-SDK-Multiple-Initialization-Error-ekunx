This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in Firebase applications: multiple initialization of the Firebase SDK. The `multipleInitBug.js` file shows code that accidentally initializes Firebase twice, leading to unexpected behavior and potential errors. The solution, found in `multipleInitSolution.js`, shows how to prevent this problem using a singleton pattern or conditional initialization.
