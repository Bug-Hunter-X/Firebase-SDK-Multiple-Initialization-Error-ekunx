The Firebase SDK may throw an error if it is initialized multiple times. This can happen if you accidentally call `firebase.initializeApp()` more than once, or if you have multiple instances of the Firebase SDK loaded on your page.  This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes, as the SDK might not function correctly in this situation.  It won't always produce a clear error message, making it hard to debug.
